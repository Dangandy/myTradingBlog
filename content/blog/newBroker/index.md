TLDR; If you want to get trading within an hour, use Hugosway

After the long awaited registration process (I waited months), I finally got past the KYC process of Interactive Broker (IB) and was ready to start live trading!! Or so it seems..

I will try to describe my unbiased experience with the IB below.

# Registration

The registration was actually quite simple, as you only have to provide 2 pieces of identification: Driver License/passport, and a bill of any sort (in my case I provided my account statement from Questrade).

In theory, this should take less than a week, because the staff at IB are on top of things and reviewed each of my documents within an hour. This quick turnaround has its benefits and drawbacks. Since I kept submitting incorrect format for the documents, I was locked out for over 24 hours.

Thus, make sure you have the same address on both identification to prevent further delays.

# User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

The UI of IB is quite intuitive. I was able to navigate around the website and was able to place trades relatively easily, but one thing was missing, Foreign Exchange trading, and no matter how hard I looked, I was not able to enable this feature.

After much research, the only way to have this enabled was either through the initial registration process, or have your profile re-evaluated by an IB team member.

At this point, I just want to start trading and make some \$\$\$\$, so I evaluated my options and checked out other brokers.

# Introducing Hugosway

I first noticed Hugosway through a post on reddit. The Original Poster (OP) was able to trade Crypto, Forex, and gold with this broker, and I was instantly sold on the idea.

I bought my first bitcoin when it was under \$1000, and have experience gold through trading etfs like NUGT and DUST so this platform is like a dream come true. Hugosway is like a dream come true, everything packaged in one.

After a painless no KYC registration process, I deposited my \$100 in btc and started trading.

# Too easy

I was able to begin trading everything within an hour, ONE HOUR!! What took IB months to process, took Hugosway 1 hour. I may not be able to deposit money into a bank due to the lack of KYC, but I don't plan to do that at the moment.

After installing MetaTrader4 (MT4) on my phone, I purchased 0.02 lot of Bitcoin as test to see how things worked and immediately got stopped out and losing 30% of my account.. Over the 30 minutes of my first trade, BTC dropped \$300, and I thought 0.02 was 2% of my account, but it was actually lots (a totally different concept to the size of your account)

# Conclusion

Here are my notes to everyone trading cryptocurrency on margin:

- use Hugosway (I will link my referral if I find one)
- trade in small lots due to the high volatility
- swaps are interest that occur from holding an asset
