I have much to learn from this trading endeavor; about the charts, about the fundamentals, and about myself.

I have come to the realization that I don't like being wrong. Especially when it comes to trading..

But let's face it, admitting you're wrong is hard to swallow, and even harder when your wrong decisions make you lose money.

Throughout this trade, I have been adding more to my position in small increments (2%) and pushed my Stop Loss (SL) to the second support.

On the bright side, my trade is positive, and my position is currently over 30 pips green.
I am not certain of the actual profit as several TP has been hit to shrink my position down to 2% as of writing.
