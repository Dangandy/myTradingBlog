## TLDR

- Scalped and increased my lot size but lowered my position
- pushed my stop loss to second support ( based on dynamic pivots )
- changed value of RSI to 14

## Updates

Throughout this trade, I have been adding more to my position in small increments (2%) and pushed my Stop Loss (SL) to the second support.

On the bright side, my trade is positive, and my position is currently over 30 pips green.
I am not certain of the actual profit as several TP has been hit to shrink my position down to 2% as of writing.

## Adjustment to Strategy

### RSI

I noticed that my rsi value was too low (6), due to it being adjusted to the crypto market.
Thus, I reverted it back to 14, and will backtest values around it that will yield maximum profit.

## Takeaways

I have come to the realization that I don't like being wrong. Especially when it comes to trading..

But let's face it, admitting you're wrong is hard to swallow, and even harder when your wrong decisions make you lose money.

Although I have gained a profit on todays trade, I am not proud of it.

Adamantly adding more to my losing position, may work out today, but there will be a time when this strategy will yield even greater losses.
